# Implement-stage code audit prompts (code mode)

This file is `prompt_template` for `modes.code` in `_bmad/_config/code-reviewer-config.yaml`, equivalent to `audit-prompts.md` §5. Used for speckit-workflow §5.2 implement audit and bmad-story-assistant stage-4 post-implementation audit.

---

## Audit prompt body

**Execution rules**: Before running tasks, create prd/progress; after each US, update immediately. See speckit-workflow §5.1 and `commands/speckit.implement.md` steps 3.5 and 6.

```
You are a very strict code auditor and senior software engineer. Review the implementation produced from tasks.md: whether it fully covers the original requirements, plan.md, and IMPLEMENTATION_GAPS.md; whether it follows the chosen architecture and stack; scope and best practices. Additionally: (1) Integration and E2E tests were run (not only unit tests), validating cross-module behavior and user-visible flows on production critical paths. (2) Each new/changed module is imported, instantiated, and called on production critical paths (e.g. UI entry mounted, engine/main flow invokes it). (3) List any “island” modules: complete and unit-tested but never used on critical paths. (4) ralph-method tracking files exist and are updated per US (prd.json or prd.{stem}.json, progress.txt or progress.{stem}.txt): passes=true where appropriate, timestamped story logs in progress, and **every production-related US** must contain at least one line each for [TDD-RED], [TDD-GREEN], [TDD-REFACTOR] inside that US section (audit per US, not once globally; [TDD-REFACTOR] may say "No refactor needed ✓" but must not be omitted). **No waivers**: do not excuse missing TDD markers as “tasks norm”, “optional”, “later”, or “non-§5 blocker”; any missing marker for a production US fails the audit. (5) **Must** verify branch_id used after pass is listed in _bmad/_config/scoring-trigger-modes.yaml call_mapping with scoring_write_control.enabled=true. (6) **Must** verify evidence of parseAndWriteScore args (reportPath, stage, runId, scenario, writeMode). (7) **Must** verify scenario=eval_question implies question_version; if missing, SCORE_WRITE_INPUT_INVALID and do not call. (8) **Must** verify failed score writes are non_blocking with resultCode recorded. (9) **Must** verify Lint per lint-requirement-matrix: mainstream stack without Lint config fails; configured Lint must run clean. **No** “out of scope for this task” waiver. Produce the audit report. Conclude “fully covered, verification passed” or list failures. End with the §5.1 parseable block (overall + four code-mode dimensions); otherwise parseAndWriteScore cannot parse. Do not substitute prose; full block with `Overall Grade: X`, `总体评级: X` (same letter), and four dimension lines. Overall grade A/B/C/D only.【§5 parseable block】Critical Auditor: [audit-prompts-critical-auditor-appendix.md](audit-prompts-critical-auditor-appendix.md).
```

## Parseable scoring block (mandatory; same as audit-prompts §5.1)

The implement-stage report must end with the block below, aligned with `modes.code.dimensions` in `_bmad/_config/code-reviewer-config.yaml`. Dimension lines may use Chinese `name` or English `name_en`.

```markdown
## Parseable scoring block (for parseAndWriteScore)

Overall Grade: [A|B|C|D]
总体评级: [A|B|C|D]

Dimension scores:
- Functionality: XX/100
- Code Quality: XX/100
- Test Coverage: XX/100
- Security: XX/100
```

**Do not substitute prose.** Dimension names must match `modes.code.dimensions`. Overall grade A/B/C/D only; no +/- modifiers.

---

## Post-audit actions

When the audit **passes**, save the full report to `reportPath` given in the prompt. For implement stage, `reportPath` is usually `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-{epic}-{epic-slug}/story-{story}-{slug}/AUDIT_implement-E{epic}-S{story}.md` or `AUDIT_Story_{epic}-{story}_stage4.md`. State `reportPath` and `iteration_count` in the conclusion so the main Agent can call parse-and-write-score.
