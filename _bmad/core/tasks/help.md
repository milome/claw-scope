# Task: BMAD Help

## ROUTING RULES

- **Empty `phase` = anytime** — Universal tools work regardless of workflow state
- **Numbered phases indicate sequence** — Phases like `1-discover` → `2-define` → `3-build` → `4-ship` flow in order (naming varies by module)
- **Stay in module** — Guide through the active module's workflow based on phase+sequence ordering
- **Descriptions contain routing** — Read for alternate paths (e.g., "back to previous if fixes needed")
- **`required=true` blocks progress** — Required workflows must complete before proceeding to later phases
- **Artifacts reveal completion** — Search resolved output paths for `outputs` patterns, fuzzy-match found files to workflow rows

## DISPLAY RULES

### Command-Based Workflows
When `command` field has a value:
- Show the command prefixed with `/` (e.g., `/bmad-bmm-create-prd`)

### Agent-Based Workflows
When `command` field is empty:
- User loads agent first via `/agent-command`
- Then invokes by referencing the `code` field or describing the `name` field
- Do NOT show a slash command — show the code value and agent load instruction instead

Example presentation for empty command:
```
Explain Concept (EC)
Load: /tech-writer, then ask to "EC about [topic]"
Agent: Tech Writer
Description: Create clear technical explanations with examples...
```

## MODULE DETECTION

- **Empty `module` column** → universal tools (work across all modules)
- **Named `module`** → module-specific workflows

Detect the active module from conversation context, recent workflows, or user query keywords. If ambiguous, ask the user.

## INPUT ANALYSIS

Determine what was just completed:
- Explicit completion stated by user
- Workflow completed in current conversation
- Artifacts found matching `outputs` patterns
- If `index.md` exists, read it for additional context
- If still unclear, ask: "What workflow did you most recently complete?"

## EXECUTION

1. **Load catalog** — Load `{project-root}/_bmad/_config/bmad-help.csv`

2. **Resolve output locations and config** — Scan each folder under `_bmad/` (except `_config`) for `config.yaml`. For each workflow row, resolve its `output-location` variables against that module's config so artifact paths can be searched. Also extract `communication_language` and `project_knowledge` from each scanned module's config.

3. **Ground in project knowledge** — If `project_knowledge` resolves to an existing path, read available documentation files (architecture docs, project overview, tech stack references) for grounding context. Use discovered project facts when composing any project-specific output. Never fabricate project-specific details — if documentation is unavailable, state so.

4. **Detect active module** — Use MODULE DETECTION above

5. **Analyze input** — Task may provide a workflow name/code, conversational phrase, or nothing. Infer what was just completed using INPUT ANALYSIS above.

6. **Present recommendations** — Show next steps based on:
   - Completed workflows detected
   - Phase/sequence ordering (ROUTING RULES)
   - Artifact presence

   **Optional items first** — List optional workflows until a required step is reached
   **Required items next** — List the next required workflow

   For each item, apply DISPLAY RULES above and include:
   - Workflow **name**
   - **Command** OR **Code + Agent load instruction** (per DISPLAY RULES)
   - **Agent** title and display name from the CSV (e.g., "🎨 Alex (Designer)")
   - Brief **description**

7. **Additional guidance to convey**:
   - Present all output in `{communication_language}`
   - Run each workflow in a **fresh context window**
   - For **validation workflows**: recommend using a different high-quality LLM if available
   - For conversational requests: match the user's tone while presenting clearly
   - When recommending Create Story or Dev Story: add "Solo 快速迭代：默认不创建新 branch/worktree，可在当前目录继续；需完整隔离时使用 -CreateBranch -CreateWorktree。"

8. Return to the calling process after presenting recommendations.
